        <p class="fs-7">
          <em>Game-based learning</em>  refers to the borrowing of certain gaming principles and applying them to real-life settings to engage users.
          While <em>Development Dyscalculia</em> is a specific learning disability that affects the normal acquisition of arithmetic skill. 
          Despite the absence of commonality between the two terms, this research aims to add to our existing knowledge on both topic by designing and evaluating 
          the effectiveness of a Game-Based solution to aid adults struggling with dyscalculia.
