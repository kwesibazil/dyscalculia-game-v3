      <h2>What is Dyscalculia?</h2>
      <p> Dyscalculia is a condition that affects the ability to acquire arithmetical skills. Dyscalculic learners may have difficulty understanding simple number concepts, lack an intuitive grasp of numbers, and have problems learning number facts and procedures. Even if they produce a correct answer or use a correct method, they may do so mechanically and without confidence.</p> 
      <p>However, <strong>Dyscalculia is not a reflection of low intelligence</strong>, nor does it mean a person will not be successful working through higher order mathematical reasoning. Rather, persons with dyscalculia simply think and learn differently from others, and are be more prone to making mistakes when working with numbers.</p>

      <h2 class="">How common is it?</h2>
      <p>Dyscalculia is under studied and under resourced in comparison with dyslexia. However, it is estimated that dyscalculia is likely to occur in approximately 3–7% of all children, adolescents, and adults. Additionally, unlike some other specific learning difficulties, dyscalculia is as likely to affect females as males.</p>
